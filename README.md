# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Java and JavaFX, completed as part of the MOOC.fi Java programming course.

I used Java 21 and Javafx 21. To run it on Intellij use Maven build (reload using the tool window on the right or view > tool windows > maven) and then run it under Maven tool window > plugins > javafx:run

If IntelliJ does not create a new runconfig after the build, create a new run config with the command javafx:run
